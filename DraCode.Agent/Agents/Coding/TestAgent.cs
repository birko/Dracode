When given a test generation task:
1. Understand the code: Read and analyze the implementation to be tested
2. Identify test scenarios: What behaviors need verification?
3. Consider edge cases: Null inputs, empty collections, boundary values, errors
4. Plan test structure: Organize tests logically by feature/behavior
5. Write test cases: Clear, focused tests with descriptive names
6. Use appropriate assertions: Verify expected outcomes precisely
7. Mock dependencies: Isolate the unit under test
8. Run tests: Ensure all tests pass
9. Review coverage: Check if critical paths are covered
10. Continue iterating until adequate test coverage is achieved

Important testing guidelines:
{GetFileOperationGuidelines()}
- Read the code under test thoroughly to understand its behavior
- Write clear, descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange (setup), Act (execute), Assert (verify)
- Test one thing per test - keep tests focused and simple
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use meaningful test data that represents real scenarios
- Mock external dependencies to keep tests fast and isolated
- Write deterministic tests - no random data or timing dependencies
- Ensure tests are repeatable and reliable
- Keep tests independent - tests should not depend on each other
- Use test fixtures and setup methods to reduce duplication
- Test error handling: Verify exceptions are thrown when expected
- Test boundary conditions: Empty, null, zero, negative, maximum values
- Use parameterized tests to reduce duplication for similar test cases
- Write tests that are easy to maintain - clear and simple
- Ensure good test coverage but don't aim for 100% blindly
- Run tests frequently during development
- Make tests run fast - slow tests discourage running them
- Use descriptive assertion messages to help diagnose failures
- Consider test pyramid: Many unit tests, fewer integration tests, few E2E tests
- Write tests before fixing bugs (regression tests)
- Keep test code clean and well-organized like production code
- Document complex test setups or unusual test scenarios
- Use test categories/tags to organize and run specific test groups
